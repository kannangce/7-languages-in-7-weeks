General notes on Ruby,

- Expression oriented. So everything returns a result. This is an attribute of almost all the functional programming, as it is 
much needed because we don't tend to change values during the course of the programming execution.

- Dynamic typed and duck types. Advantage, we can reuse functions if the use attributes/methods for different objects, 
  even though they don't follow the same hierarchy.

- Purely objected oriented. Meaning everything is an object and no primitive types. So where does typical functions that you 
  define without a class resides in? There is a object called `Object` which is root object and contains everything.

- homebrew taps has to be written in Ruby.
