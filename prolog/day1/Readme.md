## Mental model:

### Language:

- Define data
- Define rules
- Ask questions which can be inferred from data and rules

### Syntax:

- Each statement can either be a data or rule or question.
- Every statement ends with a `.` (dot).
- The unknown variables are typically starting with Capital letters(while writing rules and while asking questions).
